In his heydays, the legendary actor, film producer, director, musician, and politician had a chunky share of sexual relationships, several of which produced children, among whom is Scott Eastwood. Meanwhile, sharing the last name, “Eastwood” with Scott, are his siblings from six different women. Let’s get to know them one after the other.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-scott-eastwoods-brother-and-sisters></span><strong>Meet&nbsp;</strong><strong>Scott Eastwood’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Brother and Sisters?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-kathryn-eastwood></span><strong>1. Kathryn Eastwood</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kathryn Eastwood is the younger sister and only full sibling of Scott Eastwood. She was born as Kathryn Ann Reeves on February 2, 1988, in Carmel, California, U.S.A. Their mother, Jacelyn Reeves, is a former air hostess with whom Clint Eastwood had as a five-year secret affair. Both Kathryn and Scott (born as Scott Clinton Reeves on March 21, 1986) went by their birth names until they made it to the limelight. This was because Clint didn’t initially own up to their paternity.</p><p>Just like her father and elder brother, Kathryn Eastwood is pursuing an acting career. She has since appeared in a number of films including Jersey Boys (2014), American Virus (2015), and Virus of the Dead (2018).

Laurie is a product of another secret dalliance of Clint Eastwood in the early 1950s. Clint had just started dating Margaret Johnson in the summer of 1953. He, however, could not confine his burning passions to his would-be bride but spread it to a young lady in Seattle whom he impregnated before he could say “I do” to Johnson in December of the same year. Laurie arrived the next year but with her father already married and gone, her mother (whose identity remains withheld) gave her up for adoption.</p><p>Interestingly, Clint’s secret lover listed him as Laurie’s father at her birth. Growing up into adulthood, Laurie decided to trace her biological parenthood, and this clue helped her to succeed around 1993 when she was already 39. From thence, she has maintained a very amiable relationship with Clint Eastwood who heartily accepted her. Despite attending events with Eastwood all theses while the media have been oblivious of Laurie’s real identity. She only opened up about her identity at the launch of Clint Eastwood’s latest movie, The Mules in December 2018.</p><p>Laurie Murray is married with two children – Lowell Thomas IV Murray a.k.a LT and Kelsey Hayford.
