Constantly training, hitting, and being hit. I didn’t really get much time to be a kid, but If I’m being honest, it was so much better than being a kid. Fighting gave me a real dad, real brothers, and real lessons in drive, determination, goals etc. that you don’t normally see in someone that age. I think it’s about time I got back to my basics.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>Uriah Justus</a> (@uriahjustus) on Mar 17, 2019 at 10:30am PDT</p><h2><span id=Uriah_Shelton_Wiki_Age_Childhood_and_Education>Uriah Shelton Wiki: Age, Childhood, and Education</span></h2><p>Uriah Shelton was born on the 10th March 1997 in Dallas, Texas USA, however, he grew up in a small river community Magnolia Springs, Alabama, south of Mobile. During his childhood years, Uriah became interested in martial arts, but also learned how to play piano, and was interested in soccer. As early as seven years of age, Uriah went to a modeling class with his cousin named Charli, which was just the start, as he went to a talent competition in Orlando, where he secured deals with several agencies headquartered in New York City and Los Angeles. Encouraged by his success, he moved to Los Angeles with his mother, as he felt that acting was his true calling and that he would have more chances of succeeding there.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Once settled in Los Angeles, Uriah started appearing in various commercials, but also pursued martial arts training, and in 2006 became the ATA Tae Kwon Do California State Champion in all categories. After this he returned to acting, and in 2007 made his on-screen debut in the TV series “Without a Trace”. Although a minor role, it was enough to secure him another role, this time in the TV series “Ghost Whisperer. He continued to build up his portfolio with appearances in TV series, such as “Trust Me” in which he played Jack McGuire in three episodes, while in 2009 he made his film debut in the comedy “Opposite Day”, and later the same year portrayed Kit in the family drama film “Alabama Moon”, co-starring Jimmy Bennett and Gabriel Basso.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom>Rise to Stardom</span></h2><p>Gradually, Uriah’s career was improving and in 2010 he had one of his most prominent roles to date, as Henry Matthews in the drama film “Lifted”. He received positive critiques for his work on the film, which made him quite popular with the public, but also with casting directors and producers. The same year, he featured in the television romantic drama film “A Soldier’s Love Story”. Young Uriah continued quite successfully, first with the role of Jeff Cargill in the TV action crime-drama series “The Glades” and featured in over 35 episodes of the award-winning series from 2010 to 2013, while from 2012 to 2014 portrayed Josh in the TV drama series “Blue”, which was yet another successful role for this fantastic young actor. It felt like nothing could have stopped him on his way to stardom, and so it was, and he continued with fantastic roles – in 2014 he was chosen for the part of Joshua Matthews&nbsp; in “Girl Meets World” (2014-2017), then Jack in the film “Enter The Warriors Gate” in 2016, and in 2017 he was Pratters in the highly-acclaimed TV series “13 Reasons Why”. The same year he starred in the adventure film “Flock of Four”, while in 2018 he was Julian Myers in the TV series “The Romanoffs”.</p><h2><span id=Uriah_Shelton_Net_Worth>Uriah Shelton Net Worth</span></h2><p>Since launching his career, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Uriah</a> featured in over 30 film and TV titles, all of which contributed to his wealth.
