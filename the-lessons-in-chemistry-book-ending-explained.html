Although her contributions to abiogenesis (the theory that life rose from non-life forms billions of years ago) blow that of her male counterparts out of the water, Elizabeth’s credibility is questioned at every corner.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Along the way, Elizabeth meets and falls in love with Calvin Evans (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Lewis Pullman in the limited series</a>), a famous and renowned scientist with whom she works at Hastings. Because of her male-dominated field, Elizabeth dodges accusations that she’s “sleeping her way to the top.”</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>In reality, Calvin sees Elizabeth for the intelligent, funny, and opinionated chemist she is, and eventually, they have a daughter together, Madeleine Zott, or Mad Zott for short.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lessons-in-chemistry-brie-larson-lewis-pullman.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Elizabeth and Calvin never marry, so Mad being born out of wedlock becomes the crux upon which Hastings Research Institute hinders their decision to fire Elizabeth. Eventually, she is approached by Walter Pine, a television producer at KCTV who offers her a job as host of a daytime cooking show called Supper at Six.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Elizabeth accepts because she needs the income to support her family. She loves to cook, after all, and she’s great at it. She proceeds headfirst into the venture, but her adamant demand that she be able to incorporate chemistry into the gig goes overlooked by Walter until the cameras start rolling and it’s too late to stop her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-Sussman-as-Walter-in-Apple-TV-Plus-Lessons-in-Chemistry.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Before long, Supper at Six becomes a national sensation, and Elizabeth is its unsuspecting star. All the while, Elizabeth works overtime to continue her chemistry career, even remodeling her home kitchen into a science lab. Supper at Six is fine and dandy, but chemistry is her passion.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>She belongs in the lab, not the kitchen, and she will do anything in her power to get back to Hastings Research Institute, or any science lab for that matter.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rainn-Wilson-as-Phil-Lebensmal-in-Apple-TV-Lessons-in-Chemistry-.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Still, there’s no denying Elizabeth’s magnetism. Women all around the world tune into Supper at Six religiously, keen to absorb any bits of advice Elizabeth imparts, which nine times out of ten contain a chemistry flair. Meanwhile, KCTV’s executive producer Phil Lebensmal loathes everything about Elizabeth’s unruly nature.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>All he wants her to do is stick to the teleprompters, promote their sponsors, and smile. But Elizabeth marches to the beat of her own drum.</p><h2 id=h-how-does-lessons-in-chemistry-end data-injectable=false>How does Lessons in Chemistry end?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lessons-in-chemistry.jpg><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>By the time we near the third act of Lessons in Chemistry, an entire subplot has been co-existing alongside the nationwide uproar about Elizabeth’s tenure on Supper at Six. Mad, Elizabeth’s genius daughter, is on the hunt to learn more about her father, Calvin Evans.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Now, one thing we didn’t state earlier that must be said now is that Calvin is accidentally killed early on in the book. We’re burying this detail in case the average reader wishes to experience that bombshell on their own. Nevertheless, his death creates ripples throughout both Elizabeth’s and Mad’s life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mad-Zott-Lessons-in-Chemistry.jpg><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Determined to learn about her father, Mad buries herself in research at the library where she eventually crosses paths with Reverend Wakey, who, it just so happens, was once pen pals with her father. Mad is drip-fed various facts about Calvin from Wakey, her neighbor-slash-family-friend Harriet, and research of her own finding.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>Over time, she learns that Calvin was an orphan at All Saints Home for Boys in Sioux City. His love for science took root after a mysterious man associated with a foundation began donating science books to the orphanage.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, Supper at Six experiences a massive surge in ratings after Walter Pine takes over for Lebensmal as executive producer of KCTV. This came after Lebensmal’s attempt to physically and sexually assault Elizabeth for disobeying orders (an occurrence Elizabeth is unfortunately all too familiar with). As a result of Supper at Six’s uptick in popularity, Elizabeth is approached by Franklin Roth, an award-winning journalist, looking to conduct an exclusive interview for Life Magazine.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Elizabeth is accustomed to turning down these kinds of interviews because usually, all they want is an inside scoop into her relationship with Calvin Evans. This time, however, she’s reassured that the article will focus solely on her professional career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brie-Larson-as-Elizabeth-Zott-in-Apple-TV-Plus-Lessons-in-Chemistry-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>It does. The article is immaculate and peels back the curtain into Elizabeth’s career triumphs and tribulations. Unfortunately, that’s not the article Roth’s editor at Life wants to publish, so what goes out into the world is a superficial cover that glosses over any and all of Elizabeth’s accomplishments. Just like that, she is tossed back into the box society demands she live inside and her chemistry career is ruined.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brie-Larson-as-Elizabeth-Zott-in-Apple-TV-Plus-Lessons-in-Chemistry.-.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Elizabeth plunges into a deep depression that spans several months. Then, out of the blue, her former colleague at Hastings, Miss. Frask — who once co-conspired to get her fired —&nbsp; reveals that she was so incensed by Life’s article that she wrote to complain.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>As it turns out, the Parker Foundation — the foundation that funds research at Hastings — got hold of this letter and conducted an investigation into the unethical behavior at Hastings and its head honcho, Dr. Donatti. Frask now works as head of personnel and she wants Elizbeth to join her as head of chemistry.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Derek-Cecil-as-Dr.-Robert-Donatti-in-Apple-TV-Plus-Lessons-in-Chemistry.jpg><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>It’s all too good to be true, though. Elizabeth soon discovers that Avery Parker, the woman behind the Parker Foundation is actually Calvin’s biological mother. Knowing the turmoil Calvin endured at All Saints orphanage, Elizabeth is reluctant to pay Avery any mind, let alone accept the job as head chemist. However, Avery quickly explains the whole story.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>It turns out that, like Elizabeth, Avery got pregnant and gave birth to Calvin before she was married. Worse, she was a teenager, and because of that, she was forced to give Calvin up for adoption. When she was old enough to seek Calvin out, she sent her lawyer Mr. Wilson to inquire after Calvin at All Saints. In the hope of squeezing some pity money from Mr. Wilson, the bishop at All Saints lied and said Calvin had died.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>The bishop’s plan backfired, however, because the Parker Foundation traded money in favor of science book donations in Calvin’s honor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Beau-Bridges-as-Wilson-in-Apple-TV-Plus-Lessons-in-Chemistry.jpg><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>When Calvin eventually became famous for his contributions to science, Avery tried tirelessly to contact him. Under the assumption that she was a random lady seeking his money, though, Calvin ignored her. By the time she tried to seek him out in person, it was too late.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Now, Avery is hoping to become a part of Elizabeth and Mad’s life, both professionally as the private funder of research at Hastings and personally as Mad’s grandmother.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>No longer constrained by the obligations of the cooking show or prejudice in the workplace, Elizabeth resumes her abiogenesis research at Hastings, and the novel ends with her inviting Avery into her home for — you guessed it — supper.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo56ro6S7tHnIp2ScoJWitrTA0bJkm6efoHqmusOipaBlla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html&text=The%20Lessons%20in%20Chemistry%20book%20ending%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html&title=The%20Lessons%20in%20Chemistry%20book%20ending%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html&title=The%20Lessons%20in%20Chemistry%20book%20ending%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html&title=The%20Lessons%20in%20Chemistry%20book%20ending%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-lessons-in-chemistry-book-ending-explained.html&description=The%20Lessons%20in%20Chemistry%20book%20ending%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./notes-on-a-scandal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Notes on a Scandal | Reelviews Movie Reviews">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-portnoy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actor, Michael Portnoy Is Currently Single; No Dating Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
