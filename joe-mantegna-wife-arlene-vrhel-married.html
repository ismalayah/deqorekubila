According to Joe Arlene is one year younger than him, so since Joe was born in the year 1947, we can assume Arlene was born in the year 1948. Though some sources are claiming her birthday to be August 20, 1949, there has been no proof about it whatsoever.</p><p>Also, Arlene was born and raised in Chicago but moved to California with her husband, Joe. Vrhel and Mantegna most likely met while they were both in Chicago, perhaps the same high school or college. It is unknown where Arlene attended her high school or college. But if it is the same as her husband Joe, then, J. Morton Sterling High School East and Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University might be the high school or college she attended.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16853 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/eceleb-gossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Arlene-Vrhel.jfif_.jpg alt="Image of Restaurant Owner, Arlene Vrhel" width=600 height=666 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-16853 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Restaurant Owner, Arlene Vrhel</strong></p><p>There has been no information regarding her parents as she doesn’t have any kind of online presence.

For nearly two years, Joe courted Arlene, and they were a happy couple. But it all changed on October 3, 1975.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow class=IRPP_kangoo>READ MORE:Natasha Richardson's Cause of Death; Biography of Liam Neeson's Late Wife</a><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marriage></span>Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It all changed on October 3, 1975, when Joe and Arlene got married. During the nearly two year courtship period, Joe and Arlene figured out that they loved each other and wanted to be a part of each other’s life. After a fabulous ceremony, Arlene became Joe Mantegna’s wife after saying ‘I do’ in a private ceremony in Paris.</p><p>It has been 44 years since their marriage, and they now have two kids, both are adults now, but their love doesn’t seem to dissipate or dilute one bit. The I Do binding them is what everyone looks for in their life, but Joe and Arlene have found and kept it safe. One of the happiest and longest-married couples of Hollywood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arlene_Vrhel_and_Joe_Mantegnas_Children></span>Arlene Vrhel and Joe Mantegna’s Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe and Arlene have two childrens together, both daughter and both of their daughters have grown up to be strong, beautiful women. Arlene and Joe’s first daughter Mia Mantegna was born in the year 1987 and is currently 32 years of age. Mia was diagnosed autistic after her second birthday, but that didn’t stop her from enjoying her life to the fullest. She currently works as a make-up artist and takes part in Autism Awareness programs.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16854 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/eceleb-gossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Joe-Mantegna-wife-kids.jpg alt="Image of Arlene Vrhel with her husband Joe Mantegna with their kids Mia and Gia" width=600 height=455 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-16854 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Arlene Vrhel with her husband, Joe Mantegna with their kids Mia and Gia</strong></p><p>Mia’s Sister Gina Mantegna was born in the year 1990, making her 30 years of age at the time of writing this post. Gina went on to change her name from Gina Mantegna to Gia Mantegna at the age of 18. With a height of 1.64m, she stands nearly the same height as her mother. Gia is an actress and has worked in several TV&nbsp; shows like The middle, Gigantic, etc.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow class=IRPP_kangoo>READ MORE:LeeAnn Kreischer Wiki-Biography; Net Worth and Children of Bert Kreischer's Wife</a><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arlene_Vrhel_Net_Worth></span>Arlene Vrhel Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arlene used to be a stay at home mother to make sure that her daughter Mis is taken care of all the time during Mia’s early years. But as Mia grew up, Arlene also gained more freedom, and once Mia became independent, Arlene started living her life.</p><p>Arlene moved towards her lifelong dream of owning a restaurant. Together with her husband, Joe Mantegna Arlene opened a restaurant in California, Taste Chicago. Arlene started working there as owner, managerial, and kitchen staff. She put her all into being the owner of the restaurant and serving good food to the patrons.</p><p>Taste Chicago&nbsp;served dishes like Vienna Beef Hot Dogs in poppy seed bun, Pizza, and some other types of Italian and Chicago typical foods. While the restaurant was reasonably popular, it has recently closed down in the march of 2019. Right now, it is unknown what Arlene is doing exactly, but photos of her touring in different cities can be seen in her husband and daughter’s social media accounts.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joe_Mantegna_Net_Worth></span>Joe Mantegna Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As for the net worth, it is going to be the accumulation of wealth she has done from her time owning the restaurant. With her husband’s colossal<strong> net worth</strong> of <strong>$18 million</strong>, it is unlikely Arlene has any debts, so all her earnings should go into her net worth.</p><p>Arlene’s estimated net worth is in six digits, i.e., over <strong>$100,000</strong>, but it might as well in millions. Her networth has such a considerable estimation mark due to her being a previous restaurant owner in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is one of the most expensive cities to live in. So, we can expect her restaurant to have made good cash from such a neighborhood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_about_Arlene_Vrhel></span>Quick Facts about Arlene Vrhel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100%><tbody><tr><td style=width:50%>Name</td><td style=width:50%>Arlene Vrhel</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Birth Year</td><td style=width:50%>1948</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Occupation</td><td style=width:50%>Restaurant Owner</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Spouse</td><td style=width:50%>Joe Mantegna (m.1975)</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Children</td><td style=width:50%>Two Daughter<br>Mia Mantegna<br>Gina (Gia) Mantegna</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Net Worth</td><td style=width:50%>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Zodiac Sign</td><td style=width:50%>Leo</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Height</td><td style=width:50%>1.7 m (roughly)</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq6MoKasq5mle6S7zGihqJ1doq6vwMSgpZplp56zpnnAq6OeppViw7O0xKVkppmip7amsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html&text=Unknown%20Facts%20about%20the%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Married%20Life%20of%20Joe%20Mantegnas%20Wife%20Arlene%20Vrhel&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html&title=Unknown%20Facts%20about%20the%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Married%20Life%20of%20Joe%20Mantegnas%20Wife%20Arlene%20Vrhel" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html&title=Unknown%20Facts%20about%20the%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Married%20Life%20of%20Joe%20Mantegnas%20Wife%20Arlene%20Vrhel" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html&title=Unknown%20Facts%20about%20the%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Married%20Life%20of%20Joe%20Mantegnas%20Wife%20Arlene%20Vrhel" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-mantegna-wife-arlene-vrhel-married.html&description=Unknown%20Facts%20about%20the%20Dating%20%26amp%3b%20Married%20Life%20of%20Joe%20Mantegnas%20Wife%20Arlene%20Vrhel" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hayley-mills-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayley Mills Height - CelebsHeight.org">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mary-ure-cause-of-death-how-did-mary-ure-die-482526-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mary Ure Cause of Death, How did Mary Ure Die?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
