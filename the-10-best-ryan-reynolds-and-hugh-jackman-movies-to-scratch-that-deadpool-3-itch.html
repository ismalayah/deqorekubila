Reynolds has been trolling Jackman for some time, referencing both the actor and his character in Deadpool and Deadpool 2, and getting him on board for the third film in the franchise has been a goal for Reynolds’ for some time.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Now it is finally happening! Production is underway and fans getting even more hyped after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set photos leaked showing that, not only is Jackman back, but he is also sporting a rather delightful yellow number</a>. With all the attention this film is getting thanks to this team-up, fans may feel an urge to fill themselves up on some great Reynolds and Jackman content in preparation, but spread it out if you can, as at the time of writing we still have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">almost a whole year to go</a> before Deadpool 3 is in theatres.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Whilst it would be obvious to make this list up of entirely Marvel films (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can check that out here</a>) let’s have a look at some of the other offerings these actors have provided us over the years, though we may throw in a few classic Wolverine/Deadpool movies near the bottom for you – we couldn’t resist.</p><h3 id=h-free-guy data-injectable=false>Free Guy</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>If you want some classic Reynolds action-comedy look no further than Free Guy. Reynolds plays an NPC character in a video game that develops consciousness and sets out to be a good guy in a game designed to bring out the worst in people, but the real threat comes from the outside world, with his entire existence at stake.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Not only does it feature the actor as the titular character it is also directed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Levy who is at the helm of Deadpool 3</a>. The combination of these two works great here with bawdy comedy (much like in Deadpool) also tempered with great action sequences and plenty of heart.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Prestige</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Starring Jackman opposite Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, and even a guest appearance from David Bowie, The Prestige is a must-watch. Jackman and Bale play two magicians at war with one another after a trick gone wrong turns into a tragedy and something bigger than a simple illusion sets them both on a dark path.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Directed by Christopher Nolan, Jackman here plays a character overcome with the desire to be the best, and he doesn’t care what he has to do, or who he has to hurt, to achieve that.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Adam Project</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Yet another Levy/Reynolds combination, The Adam Project is a family film with a lot of heart and plenty of adventure. Reynolds plays adult Adam, who has traveled back in time from a future torn apart by the work of his father (Mark Ruffalo). But first, he needs the help of his younger self, played by the excellent casting of Walker Scobell.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>With some very similar tropes that also featured in Deadpool 2, Reynolds traveling through time to save the love of his life, The Adam Project is a much more family-friendly movie but still retains that Reynolds wit that today’s theatergoers love so much.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Greatest Showman</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Jackman has a phenomenal voice, and if you didn’t know this already, where the hell have you been? He has utilized this in a number of on-stage productions and films, but The Greatest Showman has to be one of his most joyful musical films to date. Here he plays the role of P. T Barnum, a boy born with nothing who creates a magical circus full of delights and spectacles where society’s outcasts take center stage.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Though this is most definitely a glossed-over retelling of the events on which the film is based (the real P. T Barnum was a tad more evil) Jackman’s character goes through a fall from grace before finding redemption that we love to see. This film will leave you high-spirited and no doubt signing its well-loved tunes for years to come.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Red Notice</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>If you are looking forward to the banter that will arise from Deadpool and Wolverine working together then you may want to first check out Red Notice. Here Reynolds acts opposite Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, another actor who appears to be everywhere right now, as enemies turned accomplices attempting to pull off an international heist. Once again, Reynolds’ comedic chops are turned up to the max and there is plenty of action and adventure to be had.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Though a little formulaic, audiences tuned in en masse for Red Notice, with it becoming the most-viewed film on Netflix upon its release.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Prisoners</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>If you are looking for something a little heavier than the above offerings, then you can check out Jackman in Prisoners. Here he plays a father desperately trying to find his missing daughter with the aid of Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but he isn’t going to just sit back and let the police do their jobs as he takes matters into his own hands.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>This mystery thriller from director Denis Villeneuve leaves you on the edge of your seat as it is full of twists and turns with fantastic performances given by Jackman and Gyllenhaal.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Les Misérables</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>One of the highlights of Jackman’s musical career was taking on the role of Jean Valjean in the film adaption of Les Misérables. Jackman gave a powerful performance as the reformed prisoner on the run from the scrupulous Javert and it earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 2013 Academy Awards.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Definitely, Maybe</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>For a change of pace from the above comedies and drama, perhaps a rom-com is on the cards. Definitely, Maybe sees Reynolds taking on the role of a father telling his daughter about how he met her mother, leaving the reveal ambiguous until the very end (think How I Met Your Mother). The film does some great things that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set it apart from normal rom-coms</a>, showing the ups and downs of multiple relationships all set against the political landscape of the U.S. during the ’90s.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>Though his humor is still present here, Reynolds plays a much more grounded character than he has played in recent years creating a sweet yet still funny character that we can relate to.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Though the film is an ensemble production, with many actors shining brightly including Anne Hathaway who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, Jackman still gave a standout performance that let everyone know just how talented he really his.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Logan</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>It would be remiss of us to have a list of films to watch to get hyped for Deadpool 3 without including at least one for each actor in their Marvel roles. Of all the films Wolverine appears in, Logan has to be the standout, with Jackman delivering a heartbreaking performance as the aging character surviving on the fringes of civilization.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Logan was unlike any Wolverine film before it, and both Jackman and Reynolds have assured us that the character’s presence in Deadpool 3 in no way affects the events of his last film which many felt was the best send-off possible for the character, even if we did all leave the theatres in tears.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Deadpool</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Of course, if you want to get ready for Deadpool 3 you have to go back to where it all began for this character. Reynolds plays the titular character, the Merc With A Mouth, the crass, bad, and mad Deadpool. When Wade Wilson discovers he has an untreatable cancer he leaves his love Vanessa to seek out more “unusual” treatments, treatments which leave him disfigured but also with the ability to regenerate, making him virtually unkillable.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>The first Deadpool is Reynolds’s baby, with the actor working behind the scenes for years to get this film off the ground and give fans a true representation of this character. It was a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre, and fans went wild for it allowing us a second and now third film to grace the big screen.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Bonus: X-Men Origins: Wolverine</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Okay, don’t be mad, we had to add this. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite being one of the worst Wolverine films and initially destroying the character of Deadpool</a>, this was the film where Reynolds and Jackman started their love affair with one another. It is very likely that the events of this film will somehow pop up or at least be discussed in Deadpool 3 (it’s already made an appearance in Deadpool 2) so perhaps it may be worth a watch.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>You have until May 3, 2024 to watch all these films, as that is when Deadpool 3 will finally give us the Wolverine/Deadpool relationship we’ve always wanted. Perhaps it’ll finally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">answer the age-old question; which immortal, self-healing superhero would win in a fight?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMamdmmpWowW6%2B2JqlZqqVrruwuMOsZJqmlGK1trPHZqGam5uirq95zKitop2jYsGwedKcqZqsk516tbTArWSdnZGZvbC7y2ZqZqGkmLVw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html&text=The%2010%20best%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Hugh%20Jackman%20movies%20to%20scratch%20that%20Deadpool%203%20itch&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Hugh%20Jackman%20movies%20to%20scratch%20that%20Deadpool%203%20itch" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Hugh%20Jackman%20movies%20to%20scratch%20that%20Deadpool%203%20itch" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Hugh%20Jackman%20movies%20to%20scratch%20that%20Deadpool%203%20itch" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-best-ryan-reynolds-and-hugh-jackman-movies-to-scratch-that-deadpool-3-itch.html&description=The%2010%20best%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Hugh%20Jackman%20movies%20to%20scratch%20that%20Deadpool%203%20itch" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cloyster-pok-c3-a9mon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cloyster (Pokmon)/Generation III learnset - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./miley-cyrus-uses-naked-showering-video-to-announce-dates-for-her-flowers-single.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus uses naked showering video to announce dates for her Flowers single">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
