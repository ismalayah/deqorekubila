Record of Ragnarok is filled with heartwarming scenes while packing just enough action to keep your heartbeat irregular.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>One Piece</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>Any viewers who have been watching anime for a moderate amount of time are familiar with the phrase “The Big Three.” They are arguably the three biggest and best shounen anime ever made — and One Piece is among them. It is a show that has been running for longer than many young anime watchers have been alive, but still boasts a massive fan base and a thrilling storyline. The series follows the journey of the lovable Monkey D Luffy, a tenacious young pirate with one goal—to find the legendary One Piece and become the Pirate King.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>Lovers of Vinland Saga will almost definitely find this entry just as interesting.

Light is a young genius going about regular school duties when he suddenly stumbles on a supernatural notebook that allows him to kill whoever’s name is written within.

It follows an elite team of soldiers and their battle against giant deformed humanoid creatures known as Titans. Their quest to battle and know more about these creatures leads to unfathomable discoveries that shake their convictions and put their life beliefs into question. But while Attack on Titan offers crisp action sequences, it also packs a heavy punch, and is one of the most emotional anime of all time.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Demon Slayer</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>Imagine Tarzan if he was raised by boars, a scaredy-cat who falls asleep suddenly, and a boy who carries his half-demon sister everywhere in a wooden box.
