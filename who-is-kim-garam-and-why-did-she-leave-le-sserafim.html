The fourth-generation groups have recently started to follow in their seniors’ footsteps, with the newest stars’ popularity expanding throughout the internet.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Alongside Stray Kids, NewJeans, and TXT, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most popular fourth-generation groups</a> to have recently debuted is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LE SSERAFIM</a></strong>. Within only two months since their debut, the girl group already had a number of controversies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">surrounding one of their members</a>, Kim Garam, forcing the conjoined companies HYBE and Source Music to put an end to her contract. Here is everything you need to know about this young artist whose career ended before it started.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-kim-garam data-injectable=false>Who is Kim Garam?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>Born November 16, 2005, in Sangju, South Korea, Garam is a young singer who achieved stardom at the tender age of 16 when many were still struggling to juggle their free time with schoolwork. Prior to joining LE SSERAFIM, Garam had auditioned for Source Music. That would prove to be fruitless, as she wouldn’t be able to pass the first tryout. Luckily, in 2019, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HYBE purchased Source Music</a>, giving Garam another opportunity to join the music industry by joining one of the largest companies in South Korea.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Known for giving wings to powerhouses like BTS, TXT, and ENHYPHEN, HYBE (alongside Source Music) placed their efforts into birthing a new girl group into K-Pop. With this newfound opportunity, Garam finally passed the audition and debuted as the main vocalist alongside members Chaewon, Sakura, Yunjin, Kazuha, and Eunchae. However, only 79 days after joining the KPOP group, Garam was forced to leave all her dreams behind and return to her old life.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why did Kim Garam leave LE SSERAFIM?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LE SSERAFIM (@le_sserafim)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Not long after the news was revealed that Garam would join LE SSERAFIM, allegations of school bullying began to mount against the singer. Those claims were immediately denied by Source Music and HYBE, who defended the K-Pop star by stating the accusations were meant to slander Garam, adding that the 16-year-old was, in fact, a victim of school bullying herself, bringing the rumors to a halt for a time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Nearly a month later, new evidence against Garam arose, this time with a picture of a seemingly official school violence committee document being released with Garam listed as the main perpetrator. Despite the bullying claims, HYBE’s stance on the matter did not shift. As HYBE has done in other cases of defamation involving their artists, the company pursued legal action against those the company said slandered the singer’s name and reputation.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>HYBE’s opinion of Garam would eventually change on May 19, when an alleged victim came forward with her legal representative, claiming she had been forced to transfer schools and received counseling due to Garam’s behavior. Allegedly, the student also had to drop out of her new school due to severe anxiety, panic attacks, and even a suicide attempt, all of which were alleged repercussions from the time she shared with the K-Pop star.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>The law firm representing the student also threatened HYBE, stating that if the company’s stance didn’t change, and if they remained unapologetic towards the student, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the firm would release the results</a> of the Autonomous Committee for Countermeasures Against School Violence, including an outline of the case against Garam.&nbsp;</p><p>“If HYBE continues to maintain their position that ‘the allegation is malicious abuse and Kim Garam is the victim’ without a sincere apology [to Daeryun], this law firm will protect the minor victim as a result of the violence included in the case summary. We will disclose the full text of the notice if needed.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Later that same day, HYBE released a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">statement </a>explaining that the company decided to proceed cautiously due to both parties involved being underage, and stating they would re-examine the information provided and take action accordingly. Source Music and HYBE also urged journalists to refrain from sharing malicious information, as nothing has yet been proved nor decided.&nbsp;</p><p>“Since Daeryun has organized and announced the part of the matter that actually occurred in 2018 in an advantageous manner, we’d like to say that we will also organize our stance and announce it as soon as possible. Therefore, we please ask that journalists refrain from reporting based only on one side’s argument.”</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>On May 20, Source Music tweeted an official statement regarding Garam, in which they officially placed the singer on hiatus from group activities as a consequence of the allegations made against her, claiming the girl group would continue on with the remaining five members. On July 20, Garam’s contract was terminated, and she was permanently removed from the group.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true><p lang=ko dir=ltr>[공지] 르세라핌 김가람 관련 의혹에 대한 추가 입장 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Qj80dsStPT</a></p>— SOURCEMUSIC (@SOURCEMUSIC) <a href=#>May 20, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Kim Garam now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LE SSERAFIM (@le_sserafim)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>Since the events occurred, Garam has since spoken out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">through her friend’s Instagram account</a> in a now-deleted post, explaining her side of the story. “Since I worked hard towards my dream, it’s true that I was honestly scared my dreams would be shattered because of my past actions,” she said “however, as each day went by, I became more scared of all the accusations made against me.”</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>As to the singer’s whereabouts, Garam has since returned to school, but with several consequences on the way. On July 30, 2022, an image started circulating online. The picture was allegedly of Garam’s desk at school, which had been vandalized with several insults and slurs directed at the former LE SSERAFIM member.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>kim garam was bullied in middle school. classmates covered her desk in graffiti saying "crazy bitch", "r*tarded" and spread selcas they captioned with "disabled", "r*tard" to mock her congenital condition brachydactyly. <a href=#>#TheTruthAboutKimGaram</a> <a href=#>#JusticeForGaram</a> <a href=#>#KimGaram</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jIuW4Ph1RX</a></p>— ㅁ | free palestine 🇵🇸 (@oncemimosa) <a href=#>July 30, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false><br>HYBE’s other girl group controversies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>While it is too soon to tell, it seems HYBE’s hesitation regarding girl groups has been justifiable, as LE SSERAFIM’s first controversy started even before its debut, and it’s not the company’s first round of public relations nightmares. After all, LE SSERAFIM is HYBE’s second attempt at forming a girl group under their name. In 2012, HYBE debuted GLAM, and right away it was proven to be a step on the wrong stone with controversies following them from the start.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>One of the members, Dahee,&nbsp;was involved in a money extortion scheme, in which she accused popular actor, Lee Byung Hun, of abuse, with the intention of blackmailing the innocent actor. Just before Dahee’s scandal, another member, Trinity, was allegedly an obsessive stalker, also known as a “sasaeng,” who reportedly followed Super Junior’s Leeteuk. Although it was never confirmed, Trinity left the group as soon as the news broke.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>Despite this initial reticence, HYBE has since found its own place within the girl-group sphere in K-Pop. NewJeans – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably the most popular girl act from the fourth generation</a> – is also under HYBE and ADOR. In August, the multimillionaire company also announced their plans to debut the first ever international K-Pop group alongside Geffen, called “Dream Academy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmo5mieqit0ZqkZpmemXq4tNhmm6KcXai1pnnLnpivnV2hsm6%2F0p6pmp6Zonw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html&text=Who%20is%20Kim%20Garam%2c%20and%20why%20did%20she%20leave%20LE%20SSERAFIM%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html&title=Who%20is%20Kim%20Garam%2c%20and%20why%20did%20she%20leave%20LE%20SSERAFIM%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html&title=Who%20is%20Kim%20Garam%2c%20and%20why%20did%20she%20leave%20LE%20SSERAFIM%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html&title=Who%20is%20Kim%20Garam%2c%20and%20why%20did%20she%20leave%20LE%20SSERAFIM%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kim-garam-and-why-did-she-leave-le-sserafim.html&description=Who%20is%20Kim%20Garam%2c%20and%20why%20did%20she%20leave%20LE%20SSERAFIM%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./damini-chauhan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-621226-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Damini Chauhan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-the-married-to-medicine-season-10-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the Married to Medicine season 10 release date?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
