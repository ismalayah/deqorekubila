Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000.&nbsp;But what causes it and how can it be treated?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>What is breast cancer?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an ‘invasive’ breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with ‘carcinoma in situ’, where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing.&nbsp;High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>What causes breast cancer?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply ‘out of control’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>What are the symptoms of breast cancer?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How is breast cancer diagnosed?</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Initial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours.</li><li class=class>Biopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer.</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray.</p><img decoding=async id=i-7742bb9054eeb9d6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/15/4EEF656900000578-0-image-a-30_1533739503845.jpg height=316 width=588 alt=alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How is breast cancer treated?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumor.</li><li class=class>Radiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops cancer cells from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery.</li><li>Chemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying</li><li class=class>Hormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the ‘female’ hormone estrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer.</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How successful is treatment?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumor in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>For more information visit breastcancernow.org or call its free helpline on 0808 800 6000</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaKSopZWjwW61zrCYZqaVrMBurc2cn6iqXWeFbq7Rnpikq12ZvLi6jJqqZquYmnqzsdWemKWrXZ2ys3nBq5yaq6RisKK6wp6pZpyZlrSvu9KiqmakmauybrvNZpiiql8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html&text=Moment%20Iowa%20news%20anchor%2c%2028%2c%20breaks%20down%20as%20she%20reveals%20her%20breast%20cancer%20diagnosis%20live%20on%20air&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html&title=Moment%20Iowa%20news%20anchor%2c%2028%2c%20breaks%20down%20as%20she%20reveals%20her%20breast%20cancer%20diagnosis%20live%20on%20air" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html&title=Moment%20Iowa%20news%20anchor%2c%2028%2c%20breaks%20down%20as%20she%20reveals%20her%20breast%20cancer%20diagnosis%20live%20on%20air" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html&title=Moment%20Iowa%20news%20anchor%2c%2028%2c%20breaks%20down%20as%20she%20reveals%20her%20breast%20cancer%20diagnosis%20live%20on%20air" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmoment-iowa-news-anchor-28-breaks-down-as-she-reveals-her-breast-cancer-diagnosis-live-on-air.html&description=Moment%20Iowa%20news%20anchor%2c%2028%2c%20breaks%20down%20as%20she%20reveals%20her%20breast%20cancer%20diagnosis%20live%20on%20air" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aew-all-out-2023-full-match-card-start-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AEW All Out 2023 Full Match Card &amp;amp; Start Time">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-did-mallory-beach-die-boyfriend-and-family-672169-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did Mallory Beach Die | Boyfriend And Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
